## Core features

This is why `Formelio` is awesome:

- **Based on _"Write less, do more"_ principle**

  Defining a form is a piece of cake. A single component has to be imported and used: `<Formelio/>`. Fields declaration is given as a simple property, so your code will be much shorter than if you'd use other libraries or custom components.

- **Out-of-the-box beauty**

  Worrying about styling is a matter of the past. Help tooltips and validation errors are shown in a beautiful way by default. Colors are inherited from the context, so forms will be ok no matter the color scheme (even in dark environments). Field labels, help messages and errors formatting is supported by mean of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) so, even making text bold or linking pages from field labels, you'll be writing less.

- **Dynamic fields definition**

  Sometimes your fields are dynamic, and showing/hiding one of them depends on another one's response. Sometimes you want to repeat form sections but you don't know how many times yet, as it is based on user input. Forget about having to write code for that. `Formelio` will take care of all this mess thank to its dynamic approach.

- **Accesibility by default**

  Forget about polluting your code with accesibility tags. `Formelio` already takes care of it.

**Note**: If you're looking for a highly customizable solution, `Formelio` may not be for you. Its main purpose is to make you writing less, taking care of styling itself. This limits customization in favor of easiness.
